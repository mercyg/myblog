<p>Hi there, I am Meheret Egzerab and I'm a full stack developer and author of this blog.</p>

<p>I guess you are here because you want to know about me, huh? I am not good at talking about myself but I will give it shot. </p>
<p>I create beautiful, usable, professional websites using best practice accessibility and the latest W3C web standards guidelines. All my websites are lovingly hand coded.</p>

<p>I enjoy creating and building things. I love what I do as everyday there is something new and exciting to learn.</p>

<p>I like being part of the open source community. I try to contribute to open source project in any area that I can. I also enjoy being part of the developemnt community. Wheter it is attending meetup or helping anyone to learn to code.  This is also my chance to give back to the community which helped me to get started my coding journey.</p>

<p>When I am not coding, I like spending time with friends and family, reading blog, articles, listing to podcast, running etc....</p>

<p>My passion for coding in general web developement grew when I started to really understand the potenital that a coder has. </p>

<p>I spend a lot of time learning new technologies and updateing myself with what I have learned before. </p>

<p>That is all I could come up about myself for now.</p>
