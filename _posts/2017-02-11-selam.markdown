<p>Let me start my first blog post by saying "selam" and welcome which means hello in Amharic languague. I am excited that I'm finally going to be sharing my coding journey experience with you all.<br><br> I am full stack web developer with a passion for learning more. While attending the coding bootcamp, I have been recording my journey of becoming a web developer but today I have finally got over my fear and decided to share my experience on my blog.  </p>

<p>I have started this blog in hope of sharing my experience and thoughts about becoming a web developer. I want to help people who will be passing the same coding journey. And hopefully, there will be things that other people could learn from my mistake. </p>

<p>I have been secretly wanting to start blogging for the past few months but hadn't really had a gut to write or publish a blog. I would be listing tons of reasons for myself why I should not do it. One of my main concern was that English is not my first language so I felt like I can't write.  But then, I realized that this could be a good opportunity for me to be a better writer and build my confidence by blogging. So I got to start somewhere....</p>

<p>This blog will feature lessons learned, reflections, and ideas about coding. I hope to encourage people from different background who have passion for coding to pursue their dreams. I never thought that I could be web developer or I could really code when I started learning but with the help of family encouragement and community I have overcome the challenge and now I am pursueing my dream.</p>
